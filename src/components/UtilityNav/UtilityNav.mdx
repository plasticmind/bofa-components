# UtilityNav

The `UtilityNav` component is a horizontal navigation bar that lists out and links to major products or sections within an organization.

## ActiveItem

Links are styled with an underlined on `:hover` and `:focus` interactions. 

The `UtilityNav` supports setting one of the links as the `ActiveItem` to indicate the current product within the list of products, though none of them are underlined by default:

<Canvas of={UtilityNavStories.Default} />

To activate a link, add the `activeItem` prop to the `UtilityNav.Link` component and pass it the value of the `UtilityNav.Item` component that should be active. 

For example:

```jsx
<UtilityNav activeItem="Personal">
```

Activates the `Personal` link:

<Canvas of={UtilityNavStories.Active} />

## Accessibility

The `UtilityNav` component is built with accessibility in mind. It uses the `aria-label` attribute to provide a label for assistive technologies. It also uses the `aria-current` attribute to indicate when a product in the list is set to the `activeState`.

## Todo

- Bar should collapse at smaller breakpoints
- Allow for custom CTA in right side of bar
