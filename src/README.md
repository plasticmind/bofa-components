# About Practical Design Systems 

Each day, I write daily bite-sized chunks of insight about building digital products at scale. Topics covered include user research, design systems, and team collaboration... with infrequent silliness and irreverence thrown in for good measure.

# About Me (Jesse)

I've been in the industry for 20 years, both as a solo entrepreneur and in leadership at large organizations. I started in design and pivoted to engineering, so I understand both disciplines well and can provide both high-level strategy for leaders as well as hands-on tips for practitioners.
