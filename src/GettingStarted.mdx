# Bank of America: Component Library

The BofA Component Library is a collection of shared React components that can be used to build BofA applications. Currently, this library contains only a single component, but we're actively looking for more shared patterns that make sense to include here.

This library is built for web-based BofA applications using React. It is not intended for use in native applications, or for use in non-BofA applications.

⚠️ **Warning: This library is not officially endorsed by Bank of America.** It was built as [part of a training series for design systems designers and developers](https://practicaldesignsystems.com/daily/let-s-build-a-design-system/). It's not meant to be used in real applications.

## Installation

To use the BofA Component Library in your project, first install it into your project via npm:

```bash
npm install bofa-components
```

## Importing

Once you've installed the component library into your project, you'll need to import the component you want to use into your application. For example, if you want to use the `UtilityNav` component, you can import it by adding the following line near the top of your application:

```jsx
import { UtilityNav } from 'bofa-components';
```
Then you can place the component into your application page:

```jsx
<UtilityNav activeItem="Small Business"/>
```

## Contributing

If you have an idea for a component that's shared across BofA applications that would benefit from being centralized, please [create an issue on the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/plasticmind/bofa-components/issues/) and make the case. Someone from our team will follow up within 24 hours. If it's a good fit, we'll either add it to the library or ask you to contribute code in a pull request:

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/plasticmind/bofa-components)
2. Commit your changes
3. Submit a pull request and link to that PR in your issue

## Questions

If you have any questions or feedback, please [file an issue on the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/plasticmind/bofa-components/issues/), and follow up within 24 hours.
